    ## Solution 
    void nStarDiamond(int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // For printing the spaces before stars in each row
        for (int j =0; j<n-i-1; j++)
        {
            cout <<" ";
        }
       
        // For printing the stars in each row
        for(int j=0;j< 2*i+1;j++){
            
            cout<<"*";
        }
        
        // For printing the spaces after the stars in each row
         for (int j =0; j<n-i-1; j++)
        {
            cout <<" ";
        }
        
        // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        cout << endl;
    }


//void inverted_pyramid(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // For printing the spaces before stars in each row
        for (int j =0; j<i; j++)
        {
            cout <<" ";
        }
       
        // For printing the stars in each row
        for(int j=0;j< 2*n -(2*i +1);j++){
            
            cout<<"*";
        }
        
        // For printing the spaces after the stars in each row
         for (int j =0; j<i; j++)
        {
            cout <<" ";
        }
        
        // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        cout << endl;
    }
}
}
