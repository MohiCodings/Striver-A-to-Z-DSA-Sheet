Problem statement
Ninja was very fond of patterns. For a given integer ‘N’, he wants to make the N-Star Rotated Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

*
**
***
**
*



  ##Solution

  void nStarTriangle(int n) {
    // Write your code here.

    
      // Outer loop for number of rows.
      for(int i=1;i<=2*n-1;i++){
          
          // stars would be equal to the row no. uptill first half 
          int stars = i;
          
          // for the second half of the rotated triangle.
          if(i>n) stars = 2*n-i;
          
          // for printing the stars in each row.
          for(int j=1;j<=stars;j++){
              cout<<"*";
          }
          
           // As soon as the stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
          // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
          // would get printed in 1 line.
          cout<<endl;
      }
    }
