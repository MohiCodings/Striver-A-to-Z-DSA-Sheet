Problem statement
Sam is making a Triangular painting for a maths project.

An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers starting from 1.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
1
1 2 
1 2 3

  ## Solution

  void nTriangle(int n) {
	// Write your code here

	for(int i=1; i <=n; i++){
		for(int j=1; j<=i; j++){
			cout<< j<<" ";
		}
		cout<< endl;
	}
}
